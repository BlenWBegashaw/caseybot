# ðŸ¤– CaseyBot: AI-Powered Case Matcher for Salesforce

**CaseyBot** is an AI-driven tool that transforms case management within Salesforce by intelligently matching new cases with historical ones. It streamlines customer support processes by suggesting relevant past cases and solutions, improving response times and enhancing the overall customer experience.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Case Matching**: Automatically identifies and matches new Salesforce cases with similar, previously solved cases to accelerate resolution time.
- **Solution Suggestions**: Provides relevant solutions based on past cases, helping support teams respond to customer issues more efficiently.
- **Integration with Salesforce**: Seamlessly integrates into Salesforce's case management system, leveraging existing case data to make real-time recommendations.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses machine learning models to ensure accurate case matching by analyzing various case attributes like issue descriptions, categories, and resolution methods.

## ðŸ›  How We Built It

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Salesforce data was extracted and used to train CaseyBotâ€™s machine learning models, allowing it to recognize and match cases with high accuracy.
   
2. **AI Model**:
   - Developed using **Python**, CaseyBot uses **natural language processing (NLP)** to parse case descriptions and apply semantic similarity algorithms.
   - **Machine Learning** techniques were implemented to rank the relevance of past cases to new ones, ensuring high-quality matches.

3. **Frontend and Integration**:
   - The **JavaScript** and **HTML**-based frontend is embedded within Salesforce, providing an intuitive user interface for customer service teams.
   - **Salesforce API** integration allows CaseyBot to access real-time case data and make recommendations on the fly.

4. **Automation**:
   - **Shell** scripts were used for deployment automation, while **Nushell** facilitates shell scripting in the workflow.
   - Custom **CSS** ensures that the user interface remains consistent with Salesforceâ€™s design standards.

## ðŸš§ Challenges

- **Data Variability**: Matching cases accurately required handling inconsistent or incomplete data across cases.
- **Performance**: Ensuring real-time case matching without compromising Salesforceâ€™s performance was critical.
- **Integration**: Integrating the AI model smoothly into Salesforce required careful API management and handling various edge cases.

## ðŸŽ‰ Accomplishments

- Successfully built a fully functional AI-powered case matcher that dramatically reduces case resolution times for Salesforce users.
- Improved case matching accuracy through NLP and machine learning, leading to better customer support outcomes.
